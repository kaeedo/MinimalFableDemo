# Minimal Fable Demo using Preact and Preact-Compat

The master branch is the finished version with Preact and the aliases in the webpack config set.
Switch over to the `react` branch to see the version using react
To run locally, simply issue the following commands in the root after cloning

`npm install`

`npm start`

It uses Fable 2.1, which doesn't require a separate fable deamon to be started via dotnet fable anymore. Instead webpack starts a fable compiler to compile F# to JS.
