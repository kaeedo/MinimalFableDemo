# Minimal Fable Demo using Preact and Preact-Compat

The master branch is the finished version with Preact and the aliases in the webpack config set.
To run locally, simply issue the following commands in the root after cloning

`npm install`

`npm start`

---

It uses Fable 2.1, which doesn't require a separate fable deamon to be started via dotnet fable anymore. Instead webpack starts a fable compiler to compile F# to JS.
